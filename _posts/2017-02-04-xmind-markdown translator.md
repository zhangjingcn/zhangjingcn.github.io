# xmind-markdown translator

## introduction

This tool inspired by one of my colleague who just use xmind to make summary. Xmind is good at mind mapping, it seem that when you read a book or article, xmind can help you quickly summarize the key point. But if you want to share it with others, xmind seems a little trouble. This tool help you translate xmind file to markdown syntax. In future, it may support markdown syntax to xmind.
